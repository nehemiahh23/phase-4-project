# phase-4-project

This website can be used by both pet owners and veterinarians to arrange and manage appointments for pets.  
Data is stored in SQL relational tables, and the site utilizes relationships between pets, their owners, doctors, and appointments they set.  
Pet owners can reach out to doctors to schedule appointments, and doctors can update the status of procedures like vaccinations, checkups, and bloodwork.  

Pet profiles include their name and physical statistics, which doctors may use to refine searches. Each doctor's profile will include their name, a description, and how many years they've been practicing, to allow pet owners to make more informed decisions about them.  

When an owner requests an appointment with a doctor for the first time, they are asked to input information about their pet. After that, the pet's profile will be saved and can be used to quickly book more appointments.  

A doctor may view all their current appointments and mark them as complete at any time.
